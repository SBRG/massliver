Quadratic Programming and Model Construction Attempts for Glycolysis

1.1_data_input_functions.ipynb
  This file has a function to extract data values from excel file and put it in a pandas dataframe. It also has another funciton that fixes the name of the metabolites that have an underscore in front of them.

1.1-srp-rm-glycogenolysis-withJustsmallQP.ipynb 
  Construction Notebook with small scale model (merged from Riya's and Sicily's code) 
 
2.0-srp-glycogenolysis.ipynb 
  Latest attempt to simulate small scale model 
3.3-srp-rm-glycogenolysis.ipynb
  FBA works for all the reactions in Glycogenolysis
3.4-srp-rm-glycogenolysis.ipynb
  Work in progress to get a good concentration solution
3.5-srp-rm-glycogenolysis.ipynb
  Better concentration solution. Need to work on PERCs and Ensemble modeling.
3.6-srp-rm-glycogenolysis.ipynb
  Simulation working for glycogenolysis model but need to work on fluxes time profile, Ensemble modeling
 3.9-srp-rm-glycogenolysis.ipynb
  stable model of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, ensemble model works, exports model
