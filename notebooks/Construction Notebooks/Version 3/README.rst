Quadratic Programming and Model Construction Attempts for Glycolysis

1.1_data_input_functions.ipynb
  This file has a function to extract data values from excel file and put it in a pandas dataframe. It also has another funciton that fixes the name of the metabolites that have an underscore in front of them.
