Data Extraction Code Notebooks: 

1.0-ma-uniprot-data-extraction.ipynb
 Initial attempt to extract data from Uniprot database (using random enzymes)
1.2.5-sp--ma--uniprot-data-extraction-optimized
 LATEST : Combined Km and Vm values, forms data table at the end with split values
1.4-ma-pathway-notebook-creation-workflow.ipynb
Initial attempt to create a pathway construction workflow using Amino Acid reactions (does not work)
1.0-sz--rm-Keq_Extraction_for_Reactions.ipynb
From Excel file of reaction(rxn) BIGG IDs for all pathways, extract rxn IDs to form BIGG urls. Then, extracts EC numbers for each rxn from BIGG website. Use the EC numbers to extract all Keq datas from Sabio-RK website and map the EC numbers result with rxn IDs.
1.1-ma-Keq_eQuilibrator.ipynb
Same details as 1.0-sz--rm-Keq_Extraction_for_Reactions.ipynb Updated to include Beautiful Soup code to extract exact Keq data
2.0-sz--rm-enzyme-data-extraction-sabiork.ipynb
(Final Version for Extraction) From Excel file of "EnzymeModulesList", extract UniProt IDs for enzymes to form Sabio-RK urls. Use Helium to extract enzyme data from Sabio-RK website
1.0-sz--rm--Keq_eQuilibrator.ipynb
From Excel file of "rxn_testing", extract reaction BIGG IDs to form BIGG urls in order to get full reaction names and the first EC number. Use the EC numbers to form eQuilibrator urls. Automate to adjust pH, pMg, and ionic strength (pseudo parameter for testing; still need to find standards) May need to manually extract the Gibbs free energy (no success with Helium and BeautifulSoup yet)
