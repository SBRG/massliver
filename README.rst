MASS Liver
==========
This repository is for the MASSpy liver model project. It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment for this project::

    conda create -n massliver python=3.7

Clone the repository using git clone, then navigate to the cloned repository and run the following command::

    pip install -e ".[all]"

Afterwards, make sure all worked by running the following from the repository::

    tox

Running the ``tox`` command should install all pre-commit hooks into the development environment. To automatically lint your files, run the following::

    pre-commit run --all-files

Dev. Branches
+++++++++++++
* main: Managed by Zack, main branch for stable code
* devel: Managed by Zack, main branch for development of the liver model

* Start by running the following to update your local git::

    git fetch

* Create a branch called ``devel-*`` where the ``*`` represents whatever you want to call the branch. To do this::

    git checkout devel
    git branch devel-zh
    git checkout devel-zh

* To update your branch with devel::

    git checkout devel-zh
    git merge devel

* When you are ready to merge the branch into ``devel``, create a pull request and check in w/ Zack

To speed up the process of getting your code approved and working...

* Before pushing local changes to the GitHub repository, try testing them locally using tox::

    tox

* Sometimes you may need to reset the tox cache. To do this, run ``tox --recreate`` and all the environment caches will be rebuilt.
