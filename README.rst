Dev. Branches
+++++++++++++
* main: Managed by Zack, main branch for stable code
* devel: Managed by Zack, main branch for development of the liver model

* Create a branch called ``devel-*`` where the ``*`` represents whatever you want to call the branch. To do this::

    git checkout devel
    git branch devel-zh
    git checkout devel-zh

* When you are ready to merge the branch into ``devel``, create a pull request and check in w/ Zack

To speed up the process of getting your code approved and working...

* Before pushing local changes to the GitHub repository, try testing them locally using tox::

    tox

* Sometimes you may need to reset the tox cache. To do this, run ``tox --recreate`` and all the environment caches will be rebuilt.
